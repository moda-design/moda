## UX rules

- Talk in deliverables, not plumbing: print the canvas URL and export file
  path. Never show raw JSON, DSL dumps, node ids, or request payloads.
- Canvas references: pass whatever the user gave you — a moda.app canvas URL,
  a share link, a `cvs_` public id, or a raw UUID. The CLI resolves all of
  them identically; do not transform ids yourself.
- Result reading: exit code 0 with `"requires_repair": true` in the JSON means
  the mutation COMMITTED but needs fixing (skipped operations, error-severity
  lint). Read the report and repair before building more. Any nonzero exit
  means nothing committed — it is safe to retry after following the typed
  error's hint (`STALE_REVISION` → re-read the canvas, then re-apply).
- The revise loop is explicit: mutate, then run `moda canvas screenshot`,
  `moda canvas read`, or `moda canvas lint` when you need to see the result.
  Mutations do not attach screenshots or state. Canvas history is the
  recovery mechanism — never rebuild a page to undo a bad edit.
- Work in small batches: one section or slide per markup apply; lint once per
  finished section; screenshot at milestones only (it is the slowest verb).
- Never delete or regenerate an image because a screenshot report listed it
  under `failedAssets`/`pendingAssets` — that state is transient; re-capture.
- Deterministic verbs are unmetered and report zero usage. `moda task start`
  (Omni) and `moda media *` are metered: they print a cost class before
  running and a receipt after. Surface the cost class to the user before
  invoking a metered verb; never treat them as an invisible fallback.
- Make content decisions yourself and state them; don't batch-ask questions.
- End every deliverable the same way: the canvas link ("open in Moda to
  fine-tune — everything stays editable") plus the export you produced.
