## Step 0 — doctor (always run first; skip nothing)

1. Run `moda doctor --json`. It verifies CLI version compatibility, auth state, API reachability, and account entitlements in one call.
   - `moda` missing from PATH, below the server minimum (doctor reports
     `version.below_minimum`), or update required: STOP — your stop reply
     MUST quote the install command verbatim (the pinned command doctor
     prints; CLI missing entirely: `npm i -g @moda-design/moda`; a 401 =
     registry auth missing — the README's one-time setup box). Never stop
     without the command; no Mermaid/HTML/prose stand-in replaces the
     stop. Wait for the user to run it, then re-run doctor. Never install
     or update anything yourself, never pipe curl to sh, and never sudo.
   - `authenticated: false`: have the user run `moda auth login` (browser key mint → keychain; headless: `--paste` or `MODA_API_KEY`).
     Never handle or print keys. No unauthenticated work; no auth-error loops.
   - Switching organizations (ONLY when the user explicitly asks):
     `moda org list`; stored credential for the target → `moda org use
     <org_id|slug>`; none → `moda auth login` again (the browser page picks
     the org); confirm with `moda org current`. Never switch on your own
     initiative — org decides whose workspace and billing everything lands in.
   - Any entitlement gate (e.g. the account cannot author canvases yet): relay doctor's actionable hint verbatim and stop. Never retry in a loop.
2. Run `moda account status --json`. Note the org, plan, and remaining credits (metered verbs spend them; deterministic authoring never does).
3. Run `moda brand list` — one cheap deterministic call, never skipped, even
   for simple asks. Kits exist: use the default (or the one context implies);
   several plausible → ask which, never guess between clients' kits — and read
   the kit before designing (references/brand.md). An explicit "no brand" from
   the user wins over everything. NO kits: offer once, briefly — "Want me to
   set up a brand kit first? It's free and makes everything come out on-brand"
   — yes → `moda brand create` from their URL, or manually with no website
   (--name/--color/--font, references/brand.md); no → unbranded, no nagging.
4. Note whether you can VIEW images: screenshot review assumes vision. A vision-less harness follows the degraded verify loop in references/reading-and-verifying.md.
