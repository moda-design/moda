# `moda export` — deliverable files

```
moda export CANVAS_REF --format pdf|pptx|png|jpeg|mp4|gif [-o PATH] [--page N]   # mp4/gif REQUIRE --page
            [--scope page|sequence] [--pixel-ratio 1..4] [--flatten] [--no-wait] # …unless --scope sequence
            [--video-quality standard|high|max] [--video-codec h264|h265]        # mp4 only
```

- **Export is ASK-FIRST.** The live link (share/editor URL) is the handoff,
  always — run this verb only when the user named a file or format ("a PDF
  one-pager", "PPTX", "send me a file" — their format words win, and
  platform-implied files like the LinkedIn-carousel PDF count) or accepted
  the single brief offer at handoff. Never auto-export as ceremony. Share
  the link BEFORE any export — the link never depends on the export
  succeeding.
- **Shader fills and animations freeze in static exports** (png/jpeg/pdf/
  pptx) — they render live in-app. The motion-preserving exports are
  `--format mp4` and `--format gif` (one page's animation per file, or one
  stitched film of every page with `--scope sequence` — next bullet; a page
  with NO animation rejects typed `no_animation` — that is the honest
  answer, deliver a still + the live link). When an animated canvas gets a
  static-file request, offer the motion file too.
- **A multi-scene sequence (an animated storyboard) becomes ONE stitched mp4
  with `--scope sequence`** — mp4 only, multi-page animation canvases only:
  every visible page in canvas order, page transitions included, one video,
  no `--page`. The whole stitched film shares the single-page ceiling (5400
  frames / 180 s TOTAL, so 180 s at mp4's 30 fps), so a long storyboard rejects
  typed `animation_budget_exceeded` — shorten pages or split the export.
  A canvas with no animation timelines rejects `no_animation`; gif has no
  stitched form (export gifs page-by-page). The editor's export panel has the
  same MP4 "sequence" mode when the user wants to drive it interactively.
  Without `--scope sequence` it is one page of animation per mp4/gif
  (`--page N`). Frame rate is fixed on this surface — mp4 encodes at 30 fps,
  gif at 12 — and pixel ratio (1–4) is the resolution lever; mp4/gif default
  to 1 (page resolution).
- **mp4 has two encode knobs, both optional and both mp4-only.**
  `--video-quality standard|high|max` (default `standard`) buys sharpness with
  encode time and file size; nothing about the render changes, so a re-export
  at a higher tier costs only the encode. `--video-codec h264|h265` (default
  `h264`) picks the codec inside the same `.mp4` container: `h265` (HEVC) is
  much smaller on detailed footage but needs a modern player — hand it to
  someone only when they asked for a smaller file or named HEVC. Either flag
  on a non-mp4 format is rejected, never ignored.
- **A page bigger than 4K still exports.** MP4 is capped at 3840px on the
  longest side (and a 4K pixel budget); an oversized page is scaled down to
  fit and the result carries an `mp4_downscaled_to_fit` warning naming the
  delivered dimensions. Relay it — the file is smaller than the page.
- **Sound in an exported mp4 is exactly the unmuted video fills' own audio,
  muxed server-side — nothing else.** The page timeline has no standalone
  audio track and export muxes no voiceover or music: generated audio
  (`moda media generate-audio`) ships as its own file, laid over the picture
  locally as the post-production step.
- **The hero claim, stated verbatim:** PDF exports carry real text layers, embedded fonts and clickable hyperlinks — a link on the page is a live link in the file; PPTX exports are native editable shapes and text — not screenshots pasted into a deck. `--flatten` degrades PDF to raster; use it only when the user asks.
- **Read the `warnings[]` on a completed export.** The CLI prints each as a `warning: …` line (and carries them in `--json`): quality caveats about a file that still succeeded — `pptx_shape_rasterized` (some images baked into the slide rather than editable shapes), `pptx_content_dropped` (elements missing from the deck entirely), `pdf_pages_dropped` (pages missing from the document), `pdf_page_rasterized` (a page shipped as pixels — it looks right, but its text is not selectable and its links are not clickable), `pdf_page_reduced_quality` (an oversized page rendered below the DPI you asked for), `audio_source_dropped` (an mp4 shipped without one video fill's audio — the message names the source and why). Relay the caveat honestly when you hand over the file. A warning is usually not a reason to re-run the export — the pptx and pdf rendering degradations are deterministic, an identical re-run degrades identically — and never a reason to withhold the file. Two exceptions are worth a re-run: `pdf_pages_dropped` means pages are genuinely ABSENT from the document, so say so plainly and try again rather than handing over an incomplete file; and an `audio_source_dropped` whose message names a fetch failure or timeout is transient-shaped and MAY succeed on a later export of an edited canvas (a plain re-run of the same version returns the cached file). Treat an unrecognized code as informational and pass its message along.
- Export is deterministic-lane: **zero metered credits on every plan** (`usage.metered_credits: 0` on the response). Export rate is plan-quota enforced server-side; a throttle surfaces as a typed error with a retry hint.
- The CLI polls transparently when the render exceeds the sync window — you just get the file. `--no-wait` prints the export task id and exits 0; check later with the same verb or hand the id to the user.
- Never poll with sleeps longer than 60 seconds; prefer the CLI's own waiting (the default sync wait, or `--no-wait` + re-check with the same verb). If export fails with the same typed code twice, deliver the share link + screenshots and note the export failure honestly.
- Downloads land at `-o` (default `<canvas>.<ext>` in the configured output dir; with `--page N` the default is `<canvas>.pN.<ext>`, so per-page loops never clobber). Print the final path in your reply.
- **Multi-page png/jpeg arrives as ONE zip of per-page images** — the response's `delivered_format` says `zip` and the CLI names the file `.zip`. That zip is the deliverable for image carousels; don't rename it to `.png`.
- `--page N` exports a single 1-indexed page (there is no range selection); omit it for all pages. A multi-page png/jpeg export arrives as one `.zip` of per-page files.
- **`--format webp` is rejected with a typed error** — it has no server lane. Say so plainly instead of retrying; the supported stills are pdf, pptx, png, jpeg.

Typical closes:

```
moda export CANVAS_REF --format pptx -o deck.pptx      # after a deck build
moda export CANVAS_REF --format pdf -o one-pager.pdf   # after a document build
```

Pair the file with the canvas link (`moda canvas share CANVAS_REF` prints a share URL; `editor_url` rides every mutation result) — the deliverable is both: the artifact file and the live, editable canvas.
