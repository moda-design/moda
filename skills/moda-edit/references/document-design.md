# Document design — PDFs, one-pagers, reports

Scope decides the deliverable, so settle it first. Both bullets are the
**digital document** rule — a physical print piece is moda-document-print's
lane, covered two paragraphs down.

- **One page** (one-pager, brief, handout, fact sheet, infographic) → build **2 distinct concepts** as alternate directions: different layout structure, visual density, type hierarchy, and accent treatment. Plan each in a paragraph before building, then build both as sibling pages on one canvas so the user can compare them side by side.
- **Multi-page** (report, guide, proposal, or any request naming several pages) → build **1 cohesive document**, not alternates. Plan one visual system — grid, margins, type, palette, headers/footers — plus a page-by-page outline, then vary page layouts only as the content needs.

**Two concepts, one deliverable.** A "one-pager PDF" is one page. The live link
carries both directions so the user can compare, but never export the combined
canvas and hand it back as the one-pager — ask which direction wins, or export
them separately with `moda export CANVAS_REF --format pdf --page N` (lands at
`<canvas>.pN.pdf`, so the two never clobber).

Two, not three: the social and logo lanes default to 3 (the social-craft
reference) because a feed post or a mark is a pure taste pick with nothing else
to judge it by. A one-pager is content-led, so two well-separated directions
give the user a real choice without paying for a third. Multi-page gets one —
alternates there are cost without a choice.

**Physical print pieces are moda-document-print's recipe**, not this split:
business card, resume, certificate, invitation, menu, merch, and a poster or
flyer going to press. Build the one piece, where a second page means the
reverse side — never a second concept.

Default page size is US Letter: `moda canvas create --name … --size 816x1056` (A4: 794×1123). Typography is the document ladder — body ≈ 11px at US-Letter size, floor 11px (compute per references/design-quality.md).

## Making it good

- **Pack the page.** A PDF is read up close, not across a room — it should be information-dense, and text-only is boring. Icons, dividers, stat rows, and cards break up prose and carry structure.
- **Keep backgrounds print-friendly.** Simple fills and rules; do NOT generate images for PDF backgrounds.
- **Never encode a comparison in semantic red/green** ("problem vs solution", "before vs after"). Differentiate with layout, weight, or tonal variations of the brand palette.

## Balance the vertical composition

Content top-packed with a large empty band under it reads as unfinished — but forcing oversized type or stretched spacing to fill every pixel reads worse. When the content is shorter than the page, distribute the slack as deliberate spacing between sections, and/or anchor a natural closing element (signature block, sign-off, date line, footer) near the bottom margin so the whitespace sits inside the body.

Mechanically: a page-spanning top-level `<column justify="space-between">`, or an empty `<row height="fill" />` as a flexible spacer above a trailing block. Note that a tall fixed `height` does NOT push children down — they top-pack, so a `height="340"` column whose children total 234px just leaves 106px empty below it.

If the user's instructions contradict any of the above, follow the user.
