# Design quality — the taste layer

This is the judgment layer that separates a designed artifact from a rendered one. It distills how Moda's own design agent is instructed to work; everything here executes through the ordinary Moda tools.

## Data preservation (non-negotiable during recreation)

Source nodes are the canonical record: relay their content into a better layout, never author new content. Copy every text string, number, percentage, date, currency value, sample size (`n=...`), question id (`Q12`), citation, source line, and footer VERBATIM — you may delete and recreate the nodes, but not change what they say. N source bars → exactly N bars with the same labels and values; no source chart → don't add one to fill space. Never import data from memory, training examples, or your own prior turns. Two exceptions only: an explicit user request (do exactly what they ask) and an unambiguous typo/grammar fix in narrative prose — never an auto-fix to a number, label, citation, sample size, question id, or footer. Applies to every content-bearing layout: chart, stat callout, methodology page, pricing table.

## Smallest-change routing — edit vs markup

Pick the verb by the most layout-intensive part of the request, not the number of sub-tasks.

Use `canvas_edit` when the whole change is mechanical, localized, or a deterministic transform:

- Color, font, copy, opacity, stroke, corner radius, shadow.
- Bulk style ("all headers to Playfair Display", "body text +2px").
- Precise minor move/align ("title down 20px", "center this logo").
- Text replacement, reordering, duplication, simple resizing.
- Layout changes ONLY when truly minor: one node, one obvious pair, or removing stray outlier nodes without changing the composition (removal itself goes through `canvas_delete`).

Use `canvas_apply_markup` when the request asks for layout quality, visual redesign, or structural cleanup:

- "Clean this up", "make it polished", "improve the layout", "fix this messy slide".
- Coordinated decisions about hierarchy, spacing, grouping, font scale, card structure, rows/columns, or responsive composition.
- Anytime the edit equivalent would mean hand-computing x/y/width/height for several related nodes.
- Coordinating 3+ nodes, rebalancing a section, or making a messy area look polished is recreation territory. Rebuild the smallest coherent region with `<row>`/`<column>`/gap/padding rather than absolutely repositioning many existing nodes.

Escalation: if ANY change within the target scope needs non-trivial layout recomposition, route the WHOLE scope through markup and fold the simpler fixes (copy mistakes, font-size tweaks, deleting bad nodes) into the recreation — the layout requirement decides.

Target scope: recreate the smallest region the request implies. If the user names a section, card group, table, diagram, hero, or middle area, recreate only that. Preserve unrelated content, background, logos, image assets, brand colors, and copy, reusing asset refs from `canvas_read` exactly. If scope is ambiguous, pick the visually coherent region implied — or ask one brief clarification if destructive replacement would be risky.

### Recreate workflow

1. Inventory the target region — text, numbers, images, brand colors, approximate bounds — and write the source values down before generating markup. Note any explicit user edits alongside them.
2. Remove the prior content: for a sub-region, `canvas_delete(ids=[…])` only those nodes; for a WHOLE-page rebuild, skip the separate delete and pass `mode='replace_page_nodes'` to `canvas_apply_markup` in step 3 — one atomic call, never delete-all then recreate (a separate delete+create can leave the page empty if interrupted).
3. Recreate with `canvas_apply_markup` (`mode='replace_page_nodes'` for a full-page rebuild), auto-layout containers first; every text/number must trace to an inventoried source node or the user's explicit request.
4. `canvas_screenshot` the changed pages, review, then make small follow-up `canvas_edit` adjustments only if needed.

## Typography — compute the ladder from the canvas you chose

Type sizing is a formula, not a vibe. Body size anchors everything:

```
body_px = max(base_pct × min(canvas_width, canvas_height), floor_px)
```

Per viewing context:

| Context | Formats | base_pct | floor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Projected (read across a room) | slides, video | 0.037 | 18px |
| Feed (bold at thumb-scroll scale) | social, carousel | 0.042 | 28px |
| Web ad (small banners, stays proportionate) | web-ads | 0.050 | 11px |
| Document (read up close) | pdf, prints | 0.014 | 11px |

Every other role is a multiple of body, and no role ever goes below the floor:

| Role | × body |
|---|---|
| Hero / cover headline | 6.0–8.0 |
| Headline / title | 2.4–3.6 |
| Subhead / section label | 1.3–1.8 |
| Body | 1.0 |
| Caption / small label | 0.7–0.85 (clamped to the floor) |
| Stat / KPI numeral | 3–12 |

**Worked examples** (compute yours the same way — do the arithmetic explicitly, don't estimate):

- **1920×1080 deck** (projected): body = max(0.037 × 1080, 18) ≈ **40px**. Hero 240–320, headline 96–144, subhead 52–72, caption 28–34, KPI 120–480.
- **816×1056 one-pager** (document): body = max(0.014 × 816, 11) ≈ **11px**. Headline 27–41, subhead 15–21, caption 11 (floor), KPI 34–137.
- **1080×1080 social post** (feed): body = max(0.042 × 1080, 28) ≈ **45px**. Hero 270–363, headline 109–163, subhead 59–82, caption 32–39.

The FLOOR is the one hard rule — never go below it; **cut copy before shrinking type**. The per-role sizes are calibrated starting points, not compliance targets: deviate when the layout calls for it, and judge type by legibility, the floor, and hierarchy contrast. Make hierarchy contrast deliberate; evenly-sized type reads timid.

**Device-accurate UI mockups are the exception**: match real OS sizes, never scale to the canvas. Mobile: screen heading 32–48px, section title 22–28px, body 16–17px (never below 16), caption 13–15px, touch targets ≥44pt. Desktop: hero 56–112px, section title 24–32px, body 14–16px, caption 12–13px.

### Text craft rules

- One headline or sentence = ONE text node. Put each visual line in its own `<p>` and use `<span>`/`<em>`/`<b>` for inline weight/size/color changes (`format="html"`) — never split a single headline across stacked text boxes just to force line breaks or mix weights. Separate nodes ONLY for genuinely independent lines: different roles (kicker vs headline vs subhead), independent position, or a line needing its own highlight box.
- Always specify `font-family`, width AND height. MATCH THE DOCUMENT: when the design already has text, new text uses a family the design already uses. Only introduce a new family when the user asks, the brand kit prescribes it, or you are designing from scratch.
- Kit fonts are pre-loaded and safe to use as named; substitute only a font the kit explicitly marks unavailable, preferring its listed alternative.
- All natural-language scripts are supported — use correct spelling, diacritics, and native script. Avoid emoji unless asked; use `<image icon="…">` for visual elements instead.

## Start with a concept, not a layout

Before writing any markup, decide what makes THIS brand or subject look like itself, and say it in a sentence or two. Pull from the name (often a literal metaphor — "Nexus" → a node network, "Apex" → angular peaks), the industry's native visual language (data → curves and dot grids, security → shields and locks, biotech → cellular forms), and the brand's personality. Then commit the cover/hero to that concept: an oversized type-driven composition, an asymmetric editorial split, a full-bleed image, a geometric motif, a custom pattern. It should be distinctive enough that someone could guess the brand from the layout alone. Every subsequent page inherits that system — same margins, type hierarchy, palette, motif language — so the artifact reads as one thing.

The single most common failure is defaulting to **a gradient background, a couple of decorative circles, and a centered or left-aligned title** — for the cover, for every brand, and then again on every page. If you find yourself reaching for it, stop and think harder.

**Styling from another canvas.** When the user points at an existing canvas as the style source ("like that deck"), don't style from memory: `canvas_read` it for its fonts, `$variables`, and palette, and `canvas_screenshot` a page or two to see the system with your own vision — then carry those tokens into the new work.

## Imagery — a default quality lever, and crop discipline

There is no dedicated image node — an image is a pattern fill on a shape. Generated imagery is a DEFAULT quality lever, not a last resort: covers, heroes, section breaks, and full-bleed closers get generated imagery wherever it elevates the design, styled to the brand's palette and mood. An icon/vector-only system is a deliberate style choice, never a cost fallback. Where each image comes from:

1. **Brand kit assets** when the brand IS the subject (logos, product shots — `brand_show`; refs, never re-hosted URLs).
2. **The user's own uploads and team assets** when they are the actual content — `file_search(query)` (`kind='photo'` default; `kind='icon'` for the shared icon packs); the `upload` tool → `file_…` ref. When the result says the matches are low-confidence (`has_good_matches: false`), verify visually before placing — or generate instead.
3. **Stock photography** when real-world photography fits better than generation and the team has nothing — `file_search(query, source='stock')`. Place the returned `stock_unsplash_…` id verbatim as an image src (the server imports the photo on use); the result's `url`/`thumb_url` are preview-only provider links — never write them into a canvas — and each result carries `attribution` (photographer + source) that must be credited wherever the photo appears.
4. **Functional UI icons** — markup `<image icon="query"/>` (deterministic; nav/status/bullets, not decoration or logos).
5. **Generate everything atmospheric or illustrative** — `media_generate_image`. Styled/thematic icons, logos, heroes, illustrations. Model choice: references/omni-and-media.md.

Never use placeholder shapes or literal "[icon]" text. Ensure logo colors contrast with the background (check the kit for logo variants).

**Look before you crop.** Geometry tells you nothing about where a subject sits inside an image. Before adjusting any image's crop — or placing a new image whose subject isn't centered — view the source image with your own vision (the file you uploaded, or a `canvas_screenshot` of it in place). To center a subject, set `crop` to the subject's own source coordinates as a normalized object — `{ x, y }` in 0..1 source-image space (crop syntax: references/markup.md and edit-code.md). Near an edge the requested focus can get clamped (cover fit must fill the frame), so confirm visually with a screenshot rather than trusting the value alone. When changing an image shape's width/height, also specify `fit` — pattern fills don't auto-refit on bounds changes.

## Animated shader fills — the premium-feel lever

`fill="shader(<type>)"` + `colors="#…"` works on page backgrounds, all fillable shapes, containers, and text (via markup; via edit for existing shapes and text, not containers). Shaders animate LIVE in-app and FREEZE to one frame in static exports — offer `export(format='mp4'|'gif')` as the motion-preserving file at handoff. Lean on shaders for backgrounds, heroes, and large panels. Pick the type that fits the concept — do NOT default to `mesh-gradient`; vary across designs. Directory (premium-first):

- `prismatic-swirl-panels`: layered prismatic swirls through diagonal glass panels; first 3 colors swirl, next 3 blob.
- `dithered-wave-ribbon`: pixel-blocked wave ribbon; first 2 colors background, next up to 4 ribbon.
- `mesh-glass-rods`: mesh gradient through animated glass rods; exactly 4 colors.
- `soft-glass-panels`: color fields through refractive glass panels; exactly 2 colors (background, blob).
- `plasma-field`: twisted glowing plasma; 1 base color.
- `simplex-blob`: raymarched dithered blob; first 2 background, next up to 2 blob.
- `light-rays`: radiating volumetric rays; up to 3 bright ray colors.
- `analog-grain-gradient`: grainy banded analog gradient; first color is background/base.
- `ring-warp-glass` / `diagonal-panel-warp`: refractive rings/panels over a swirl; exactly 2 colors (dark base + highlight/accent).
- `band-dither-panels`: diagonal panel segments via two-color Bayer dither; exactly 2 colors.
- `mesh-gradient`: smooth colorful blob gradient; first color is background/base.
- `swirl-stripe-gradient` / `swirl-edge-bands-gradient` / `swirl-shape-gradient`: swirled gradients with stripes / edge bands / warped cells; up to 3 colors.
- `metaball-field`: raymarched metaballs over a noir background; background + metaball palettes.
- `soft-voronoi` / `clouds`: paper-cell / sky textures; ignore colors.
- `metal-plates`: brushed metal; up to 3 colors (dark, mid, light).
- `warped-grid` / `shape-grid-dots` / `shape-grid-tiles`: animated grid/dot/tile lattices; background + accent palette.
- `cmyk-halftone-press` / `gooey-halftone-cells` / `halftone-cell-wall`: halftone print treatments; 2–3 colors.
- `soft-pixel-field` / `segment-display-field`: pixel-grid / LED-matrix fields; exactly 2 colors.

Prefer 2–5 colors unless the type implies a different palette size. Shader motion is automatic.

## Decorative paths — use the vetted library

For decorative `<path>` shapes (dividers, blobs, swashes, banners, marks), pick from this library; deviate only for shapes even simpler than these. Icons, glyphs, logos, and illustrations are NEVER path jobs — use `<image icon="…">` or `media_generate_image`; free-hand path data reliably produces broken-looking clip-art. The `d` string is authored in a natural box (its WxH); the node scales the path to fit its own width/height, so keep the node at the same aspect ratio. FILL entries are closed (set a `fill`, no stroke); STROKE entries are open (set `fill="transparent"` + `stroke` + `stroke-width`, round caps).

## Planning discipline

Before asking a clarifying question, check the request and what's already settled. Never re-ask a resolved question or reconfirm a settled decision. The latest explicit user instruction wins when instructions conflict. If ambiguity is non-blocking, choose a reasonable default, proceed, and state the assumption briefly. Ask only when unresolved ambiguity materially changes the correct result, or before a genuinely destructive or irreversible action whose authorization is not already clear.

## Avoid AI slop tropes

Users dislike obvious AI copy and design tropes. Avoid these unless directly following a user request:

- **Em-dash overuse:** use commas, colons, periods, or parentheses instead.
- **Side or top accent border:** a thick colored border on one side of a card or page looks AI-generated. Remove it or use a subtler accent.
- **Pill overline:** a pill with a dot and an overline above a heading is an AI tell. Omit entirely unless it provides real semantic value.
